Hello! I am a recent graduate from **IIT Kharagpur**, with a **B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Applications**. My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of **generalizable robot learning, safe autonomy, and efficient inference in large-scale models**.

I am currently an **Undergraduate Researcher at IIT Kharagpur** working on efficient LLM training and inference using structured sparsity, and a **Research Intern at IISc Bangalore** focusing on control, navigation, and multimodal perception for autonomous underwater vehicles. Starting **July 2025**, I will join **Goldman Sachs Global Markets** as a Quantitative Strategist.

If you’re interested in collaborating on research related to efficient inference, robotics, or safe AI systems, feel free to reach out.
